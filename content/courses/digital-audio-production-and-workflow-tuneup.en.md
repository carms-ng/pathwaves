title: Digital Audio Production and Workflow Tuneup
description: >-
  For many people, the whole digital music production process seems like a
  crazy, disorganized back-and-forth of constant tweaking. Many artists embrace
  the chaos of going back and forth between the stages, or working without a
  plan. This is fine if you think it’s the best way for you to remain creative.
  But if you look at the most common modus operandi, the stages actually go like
  this:


  * Sound design/recording. This is where you either create new sounds or select the existing ones that you’ll be using in your next song.

  * Production. Once you have all the sounds, you try to decide your hook. This stage involves deciding the structure and working on the arrangements.

  * Mixing. Once your song is canned, you mix the component parts so you get the best sound possible.

  * Pre-mastering: shine and polish. Adjusting so it sounds best, everywhere.

  * Mastering. Preparing the master copy for duplication.


  If you want the best out of your sound quality, it might be a good idea to adopt a more ordered approach. This session will help you tuneup your workflow and fundamentals.  Applying a methodology to your music production can provide many benefits. It can take years to hone your craft and get it to the highest levels, and so this workshop will walkthrough the phases above, and offer advice and strategies to identify the issues, challenges and some solutions. We’ll also look at understanding what makes a song a demo vs. ready to publish.


  This session will focus on: 


  * How to approach production generally

  * Identifying references, understanding what is doable or not, using a reverse-engineering approach

  * How to prepare to make music

  * How to organize your workflow in music-making, to ensure you have solid sessions with solid results.


  Preparation: Share your current roadblocks, these will be used to start the session.
