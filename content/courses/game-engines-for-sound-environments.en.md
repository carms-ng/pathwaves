title: " Game Engines for Sound Environments"
description: >-
  Learn methods for incorporating musical instruments and interface into game
  engines for performance, interactive music visualizers, live projections, and
  more. The workshop will be based in Unity but will provide insights as to how
  to achieve similar effects in Unreal.


  Participant Preparation: download a FREE version of Unity from <http://unity3d.com/> (I recommend the ‘Individual' license, or if you prefer to just observe the workshop that is  fine too.)
