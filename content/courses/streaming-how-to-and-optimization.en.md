  An Introduction to livestreaming for musicians from the team behind
  Transmission MTL, responsible for a multitude of pandemic streaming broadcasts
  from the local scene, to MUTEK, to the NAC. James and Ian will share best
  practices for setting up, and running your own stream with professional
  flair—covering Instagram, OBS software and the more sophistical Blackmagic
  ATEM. Demonstrating a range of hardware streaming encoders and tools that they
  use for their professional streams, they will provide an overview of the
  workflow of streaming, pros and cons for video and audio fidelity, and overall
  stream reliability, and potential features made possible using different kinds
  of equipment.
