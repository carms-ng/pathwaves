title: "Digital Distribution, Playlists and Algorithms: What Artists Need to Know"
description: "Often overlooked, distribution is one of the key elements when it
  comes the time to release music; this class will provide an overview of the
  different players in the field, how these companies operate and the different
  tools they offer.We will also try to answer the unavoidable question: how to
  get added to Spotify and Apple Music playlists? We'll explain how algorithms
  are part of that answer, as well as what's expected by music services from
  artists."
