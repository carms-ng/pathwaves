title: "Post Stereo New Sonics: Spatial, Ambiophonics, Immersive Audio"
description: This presentation will feature examples of spatialization for
  HDLAâ€™s (multi-speaker arrays), Wave Field Synthesis, and Binaural audio from
  the artist's practice and perspective. In considering space, beyond the stereo
  field, we have opportunities to expand and alter our presentation of work to
  create more immersive and interactive experiences, both in person and
  remotely.
