title: "Live Stagecrafting: Video, Lighting, Object and Scenography"
description: This presentation will showcase concepts and strategies towards a
  total art for stage performances. As musicians in the digital era, we now have
  the power to control \[D.I.Y.] our stagecraft in order to propose immersive
  experiences. Most importantly, this control allows us to build a more
  MEANINGFUL live experience, and meaning might be a key element of our
  post-COVID return to the stage.
