title: "Playing with AI: approaching machine learning as a musician"
description: >-
  If we get past the myths of AI, and what it is not, we can make use of what it
  is. And what machine learning techniques do provide is a spectrum of tools for
  processing patterns, which while very unlike the human mind, open up new ways
  of playing and making music with our human minds. 


  We’ll look at a variety of free machine learning tools with an eye toward which best fit our own musicianship, live playing, and personal musical intelligence. That means exploring how machine learning can be used for free - without necessarily needing coding school - to interactively accompany us as we play, generate more dynamic electronic materials, and help us organize digital sounds in ways that maximize our creativity. We’ll also find out how some simple play in music can help you better understand algorithms and heuristics that are now woven into the larger world - including being more prepared to understand the potential dangers of those tools in societies. 


  Music as always offers a chance to understand those kinds of complexities without demanding prior mastery of math or code, but relying on our sense of intuition and play --  our human minds at their best.
