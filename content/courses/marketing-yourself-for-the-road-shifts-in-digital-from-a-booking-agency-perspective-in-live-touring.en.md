title: Marketing Yourself for the Road - Shifts in Digital from a Booking Agency
  perspective in Live/Touring
description: How do you market your shows and tell people about it? Would you
  ever like to have a booking agent, and ever curious about what they do on a
  day to day basis? This is a seminar about the ins and outs of what booking
  agents do, and what they do for artists. This is 101 intro to booking agency
  deals (what to watch out for), how you can prep yourself to be agency-signing
  ready, what kind of early work you can do yourself in learning about live, and
  the impact of digital on the current world of tours + shows vis-a-vis
  marketing, your profile, show assets, especially after two years of pandemic
  livestreams and pre-recorded show culture while we were all stuck in our
  homes.
