title: " Audiovisual Scenography Technical Masterclass"
description: >-
  This session is a follow up to my presentation during the conference, which
  was concerned with concepts and strategies towards creating a “total art” for
  stage performances. In this masterclass I will use these examples as cases in
  order to provide a more technical overview. This will range from how to build
  a cheap transportable video screen, to the communication protocols that
  control lighting.
