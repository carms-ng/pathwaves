title: Spatial Sound
description: >-
  Description: Interactive workshop for audio spatialization to output to
  binaural or multi-channel arrays by routing audio from your preferred audio
  software into Max. We will focus on binaural, but discuss how the methods we
  build in this session can be tailored to work with speakers. We will use open
  source the ICST Ambisonics Packages and HISS Impulse Response Tool Kit
  dependent on participant responses to the survey.
