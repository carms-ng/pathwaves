        Pathwaves was created in response to the observation that musicians were
        not at the decision making table as digital technologies were evolving,
        and were subsequently not benefiting equitably from this digital
        transformation of the industry. To create the opportunity to have their
        voices and perspectives in the mix, musicians needed to have
        opportunities to increase their digital literacy.
    - description: The Pathwaves Digital Literacy Incubator supported 18 musicians
        from across Canada/Turtle Island to harness opportunities of the digital
        era. It aimed to consider technologies for positive disruption to
        empower Canadian and Indigenous musicians through digital literacy and
        support the digital innovation of individual musicians.

        Delivered virtually from January to March 2022, the Pathwaves Incubator
        consisted of conferences, mentorship, master classes, workshops,
        individual work, and knowledge-exchange.


        Together they dove into today’s new technologies - from streaming software and VR live shows to NFTs and AI assisted composition - with the goal of sparking new solutions-oriented thought surrounding the creation and sharing of music.

        creation, performance, and business in today’s digital world, while
        equipping musicians with the tools, knowledge, and resources to conceive
        trailblazing projects that reimagine the way music is made and shared in
        Canada and around the world.

  landAcknowledgement: >-
    Pathwaves is an initiative that has been designed to connect and reach
    peoples across Turtle Island which is home to many First Nations and Metis
    peoples, from Mi’kmaki in the east to Haida Gwaii in the west, Dene in the
    north to Anishinabee nations in the south, and Inuit Nunangat which
    comprises the four Inuit territories. We express our gratitude to the
    Indigenous peoples for their stewardship of these lands from which we
    benefit today.


    We wish to recognize that Pathwaves is being produced out of Envision’s headquarters in Tiohtià:ke, on the ancestral territory of the Kanien’kehá:ka nation. The region, since time immemorial, has served as a gathering place marking the area a key site of diplomacy, as well as for the exchange of culture, language, goods, and technological knowledge. It is in this spirit that we convene for Pathwaves, in a space of sharing and exchange. 


    In our endeavors together, we wish to be cognizant of the ongoing impacts of colonialism and our responsibility to actively work towards change through recognizing, honouring, reconciling and partnering with Indigenous people. We are committed to making space in this program for Indigenous participation and knowledge and to facilitate sharing back to Indigenous and settler communities.
