        Pathwaves was created in response to the observation that musicians were
        not at the decision making table as digital technologies were evolving,
        and were subsequently not benefiting equitably from this digital
        transformation of the industry. To create the opportunity to have their
        voices and perspectives in the mix, musicians needed to have
        opportunities to increase their digital literacy.
    - description: The Pathwaves Digital Literacy Incubator supported 18 musicians
        from across Canada/Turtle Island to harness opportunities of the digital
        era. It aimed to consider technologies for positive disruption to
        empower Canadian and Indigenous musicians through digital literacy and
        support the digital innovation of individual musicians.
    - description: >
        Delivered virtually from January to March 2022, the Pathwaves Incubator
        consisted of conferences, mentorship, master classes, workshops,
        individual work, and knowledge-exchange.


        Together they dove into today’s new technologies - from streaming software and VR live shows to NFTs and AI assisted composition - with the goal of sparking new solutions-oriented thought surrounding the creation and sharing of music.

    - header: The KickOff Conference
      date: JANUARY 2022
      description: >
        United musicians, tech professionals, and music industry professionals
        for three days of cross-pollinating dialogue in a virtual laboratory.
        The conference delved into the forces shaping music creation,
        performance, and business in today’s digital world, while equipping
        musicians with the tools, knowledge, and resources to conceive
        trailblazing projects that reimagine the way music is made and shared in
        Canada and around the world.


        They were introduced to forces shaping music creation and business in today’s digital world, to inspire musicians to conceive and consider new ways to explore and share their art through digital tools. The conference was designed as a co-learning environment led by guides and mentors, facilitated through interactive exercises.
    - header: The Learning Engine
      date: FEBRUARY - MARCH 2022
      description: >+
        Took musicians on a two-month guided journey to develop their projects.
        Participants worked in small teams with the help of mentors, and
        received master classes and workshops to spark innovative advancements
        in their digital literacy.


    - header: The Learning Exchange
      date: MARCH 2022
      description: >
        Convened participants once more to share their results and learnings,
        which led to the creation of an accessible repository of
        collaboratively-created knowledge.


        The exchanges provided a glimpse into how each creative individual explored the expansive range of digital tools and diverse approaches that had been touched upon during the learning journey—everything from spatial audio, Ableton plugins, effect pedals, immersive experiences, creation process, recorded music, to social media activation, integration and business planning, to a myriad of other investigations.
    - header: Legacy and Sharing
      date: MAY 2023
      description: >
        While the program has been completed, findings and learnings live on
        with the publication and distribution of the Pathwaves Report, and the
        sharing of the incubator’s Horizon Scan—available to communities across
        the country.



        Documents are available for download in the Results and Outcomes section.



        Beginning later this year, the Pathwaves Team and Ambassadors will be presenting and facilitating workshops at conferences and events across the country. If you are interested in partnering with us, please be in touch!



        Find out where we'll be in the Events section.
  endNote: "The aim of sharing these legacy assets is to connect with communities
    across the country in the hope that they are inspired by the outcomes, and
    are compelled to continue the conversations. "

    Pathwaves is an initiative designed to connect and reach peoples across
    Turtle Island which is home to many First Nations and Metis peoples, from
    Mi′kma′ki in the east to Haida Gwaii in the west, Dene in the north to
    Anishinabee nations in the south, and Inuit Nunangat which comprises the
    four Inuit territories. We express our gratitude to the Indigenous peoples
    for their stewardship of these lands from which we benefit today.


    We wish to recognize that Pathwaves has been produced out of Envision Management & Production and PHI Centre’s headquarters in Tiohtià:ke, on the ancestral territory of the Kanien’kehá:ka nation. The region, since time immemorial, has served as a gathering place marking the area a key site of diplomacy, as well as for the exchange of culture, language, goods, and technological knowledge.


    OCAD University acknowledges the ancestral and traditional territories of the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Haudenosaunee, the Anishinaabe and the Huron-Wendat, who are the original owners and custodians of the land on which we stand and create.


    For the Pathwaves project, diversity, equity and inclusion was a conscious objective of the program and was intentionally considered at every step of outreach and selection. This work involved proactively engaging Indigenous people, communities and channels in the outreach and selection processes, and intentionally engaging a set proportion of participants and mentors who identified as Indigenous.


    At the program design level, we sought the advice and skills of an inclusion consultant and a music industry professional working with Indigenous communities to better understand, approach and engage diverse audiences including indigenous people and communities, and design for potential challenges and opportunities for indigenous program participation. This included access to technology infrastructure and hardware, as well as a participant driven curriculum that followed the interests and aspirations of the musicians, as artists and community members. These were all essential features of the Pathwaves program.


    Our hope was that in developing and facilitating a co-created journey that all would learn from each other and that all voices would be heard and included and shared.
