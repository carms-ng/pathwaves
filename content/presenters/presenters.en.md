      role: Presenter
      description: >
        Nelly-eve creates dynamic visual projections at the intersection of
        sound, video and performance, and transmits the immersive, trance like,
        and anxiety-producing elements of the natural world directly into our
        minds. Her audiovisual works of extreme “end spaces” (from sprawling
        architecture to endless frozen tundra) cause both physical and emotional
        reactions in the viewer, offering a world-piercing gaze that

        awes and unsettles at the same time. While Rajotte’s practice began with an art history degree in the mid-90’s, her desire for hands-on artmaking led to a masters degree in visual arts at UQAM School of Visual and Media Arts. Exploring ideas of how to navigate and manipulate the physical states and psychological perceptions of the

        viewer, her work transports you amongst sprawling desert landscapes and desolate northern patches of forest. Recognition for her dynamic footage has poured in worldwide, with her work shown at ISEA2020, Transmediale (Berlin), Artlab (Argentina) and Lab30 festival in Germany.
